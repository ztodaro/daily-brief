    "notes": "Zach flagged as high-alpha. Chamath thesis: on-prem is the only way for companies to maintain AI capability without blowing up costs. Jason Fried quote-tweeted about leaving cloud, saving millions. Replies include: Tenstorrent $15K AI workstation, H200 server at 2 months AWS cost, hybrid approaches, data sovereignty. DIRECTLY relevant to AIR Standard thesis (local compute, privacy-first). Deep dive this in next brief with outside research on: cloud repatriation trend, enterprise on-prem AI spend forecasts, implications for residential AI compute."
